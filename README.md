Content Based Filtering Technique for spam email classification
Content Based Filtering Technique: Content based filtering is usually used to create automatic filtering rules and to classify emails using machine learning approaches, such as Na√Øve Bayesian classification, Support Vector Machine, K Nearest Neighbor, Neural Networks. This method normally analyses words, the occurrence, and distributions of words and phrases in the content of emails and used then use generated rules to filter the incoming email spams

The upsurge in the volume of unwanted emails called spam has created an intense need for the development of more dependable and robust antispam filters. Machine learning methods of recent are being used to successfully detect and filter spam emails. We present a systematic review of some of the popular machine learning based email spam filtering approaches. Our review covers survey of the important concepts, attempts, efficiency, and the research trend in spam filtering. The preliminary discussion in the study background examines the applications of machine learning techniques to the email spam filtering process of the leading internet service providers (ISPs) like Gmail, Yahoo and Outlook emails spam filters. Discussion on general email spam filtering process, and the various efforts by different researchers in combating spam through the use machine learning techniques was done.
